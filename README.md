# *Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster*

In jupyter notebooks I am sharing my interpretation of the dataset from Kaggle: [*Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster*](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

My primary goals are to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and develop machine learning (ML) models, followed by their subsequent comparison. This undertaking was motivated by the need for effective data interpretation, wherein ML models play a crucial role in uncovering patterns and extracting valuable insights from complex datasets.
